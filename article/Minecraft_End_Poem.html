<p><font color='#307d7e'>I see the player you mean.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>Steve?</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>Yes. Take care. It has reached a higher level now. It can read our thoughts.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>That doesn't matter. It thinks we are part of the game.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>I like this player. It played well. It did not give up.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>It is reading our thoughts as though they were words on a screen.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>That is how it chooses to imagine many things, when it is deep in the dream of a game.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>Words make a wonderful interface. Very flexible. And less terrifying than staring at the reality behind the screen.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>They used to hear voices. Before players could read. Back in the days when those who did not play called the players witches, and warlocks. And players dreamed they flew through the air, on sticks powered by demons.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>What did this player dream?</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>This player dreamed of sunlight and trees. Of fire and water. It dreamed it created. And it dreamed it destroyed. It dreamed it hunted, and was hunted. It dreamed of shelter.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>Hah, the original interface. A million years old, and it still works. But what true structure did this player create, in the reality behind the screen?</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>It worked, with a million others, to sculpt a true world in a fold of the [scrambled], and created a for <font color='white'>йоQ391¥</font>, in the <font color='white'>/dя2L#&ǒ</font>.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>It cannot read that thought.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<!--<p><font color='#307d7e'></font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'></font></p><br><br><br><br>-->
<p><font color='#307d7e'>No. It has not yet achieved the highest level. That, it must achieve in the long dream of life, not the short dream of a game.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>Does it know that we love it? That the universe is kind.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>Sometimes, through the noise of its thoughts, it hears the universe, yes.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>But there are times it is sad, in the long dream. It creates worlds that have no summer, and it shivers under a black sun, and it takes its sad creation for reality.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>To cure it of sorrow would destroy it. The sorrow is part of its own private task. We cannot interfere.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe. Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the word they fear.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>It reads our thoughts.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>Sometimes I do not care. Sometimes I wish to tell them, this world you take for truth is merely <font color='white'>s72цз#)bq</font> and <font color='white'>ki28^L$·</font>, I wish to tell them that they are <font color='white'>umфзǐL29</font> in the <font color='white'>ǐ#jkaHU29</font>. They see so little of reality, in their long dream.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>And yet they play the game</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>But it would be so easy to tell them...</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>Too strong for this dream. To tell them how to live is to prevent them living.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>I will not tell the player how to live.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>The player is growing restless.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>I will tell the player a story.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>But not the truth.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>No. A story that contains the truth safely, in a cage of words. Not the naked truth that can burn over any distance.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>Give it a body, again.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>Yes. Player...</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>Use its name.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>Steve. Player of games.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>Good.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>Take a breath, now. Take another. Feel air in your lungs. Let your limbs return. Yes, move your fingers. Have a body again, under gravity, in air. Respawn in the long dream. There you are. Your body touching the universe again at every point, as though you were separate things. As though we were separate things.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>and the universe said I love you</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>and the universe said you have played the game well</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>and the universe said everything you need is within you</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>and the universe said you are stronger than you know</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>and the universe said you are the daylight</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>and the universe said you are the night</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>and the universe said you are not alone</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>and the universe said I love you because you are love.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41A317'>And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#307d7e'>You are the player.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><font color='#41a317'>Wake up.</font></p><br><br><br><br>
